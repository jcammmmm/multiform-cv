        comment: >
          In this document a Chebyshev's approximation to a real valued function is performed through a semi-infinite programming problem. This reformulation uses the software tools available for optimization problems to compute the approximation. In particular, the computer program employed to execute the optimization task relies heavily in Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) method. In order to made this document self-contained, the definitions and techniques that composes the SQP method are described. In the first section, the problem restatement into semi-infinite programming terms is detailed, and some problem examples are portrayed. The following section describes the SQP techniques and core concepts that makes the method. In the final section, the sample problems shown are computed.

abouts:
  - In the same extent that I enjoy writting code, I also enjoy reading code, in my opinion this allows me to learn quickly and to be agile. I am constantly concerned with high quality deliverables, because they define my commitment and personality. I always listen my team opinions, for that reason I can adapt my objectives with easeness. As a member of an organization, my compasses are team goals and measurements. Finally, as a person who knows that high quality software is built with collaboration and teamwork, I enjoy to listen and to share ideas!
  - I'm searching for new technology and engineering challenges, that takes to another level my abilities to create software easy to use and clean to deploy.
