# About
Python script that generate Juan Camilo's CV in several template formats    
but with the same content.
The formats are:
    - LaTeX
    - HTML for desktop browsers
    - HTML for mobile browsers

This script does not provide you with the entire html o latex document, 
only provides well formated content that should be placed by hand (at least
for this version) in your templates.
